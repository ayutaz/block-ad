# Development Status

## Completed Core Functionality (Platform-Independent)

All core functionality has been implemented following Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology with Red-Green-Refactor cycles.

   - Tests: `filter_engine_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

2. **Wildcard Pattern Matching**
   - Support for patterns like "*/ads/*", "*tracking*"
   - Efficient wildcard matching algorithm

   - Status: Complete with refactoring

3. **Statistics Tracking**
   - Track blocked/allowed counts
   - Domain-specific statistics
   - Recent blocking history
   - Thread-safe implementation with Mutex
   - Tests: `statistics_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

4. **Filter Engine and Statistics Integration**
   - Automatic statistics tracking when blocking
   - Integration between components
   - Tests: `integration_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

5. **Filter List Loading**
   - EasyList format support
   - Parse various rule types (domain, pattern, exception, CSS)
   - Exception rule handling (@@)
   - CSS element hiding rules
   - Tests: `filter_list_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

6. **Filter List Updates**
   - Download from URLs (placeholder for now)
   - Cache management with JSON metadata
   - Update interval checking
   - Merge multiple filter lists
   - Fallback to cache on failure
   - Tests: `filter_updater_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

7. **Performance Optimization**
   - Aho-Corasick algorithm for fast pattern matching
   - Handles 10,000+ rules efficiently
   - Optimized subdomain matching
   - Pattern compilation and caching
   - Tests: `performance_test.rs`
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

8. **FFI Bindings**
   - C-compatible API for Android/iOS integration
   - Engine creation/destruction with opaque handles
   - URL blocking, filter loading, statistics retrieval
   - Thread-safe implementation with Mutex
   - Null safety and error handling
   - Tests: `ffi.rs` (internal tests)
   - Status: Complete with refactoring

### üìÅ Core Implementation Files

- `core/src/filter_engine.rs` - Main filtering logic with Aho-Corasick
- `core/src/statistics.rs` - Statistics tracking
- `core/src/filter_list.rs` - Filter list parsing
- `core/src/filter_updater.rs` - Filter list updates and caching
- `core/src/ffi.rs` - FFI bindings for C-compatible API

### Development Approach

Continue using TDD methodology:
1. Write tests for FFI bindings
2. Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor for clarity and performance
4. Repeat for each platform

## Git History

All development has been tracked with meaningful commits following TDD phases:
- `test:` for Red phase (failing tests)
- `feat:` for Green phase (implementation)
- `refactor:` for Refactor phase (improvements)

## Dependencies

- `aho-corasick`: Fast pattern matching
- `serde` / `serde_json`: Serialization
- Platform-specific deps will be added as needed
